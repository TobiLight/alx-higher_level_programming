# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers the basics of conditional statements (`if/else`), loops (`for` and `while`), and functions in Python. It provides an introduction to these fundamental concepts and their usage in Python programming.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain familiarity with:

- Conditional statements and their syntax (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loop structures (`for` loop, `while` loop) and their implementation
- Defining and using functions in Python
- Function parameters and return values
- Indentation and code style guidelines

## Files

The project includes the following files:

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a `for` loop.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters `q` and `e`, using a `for` loop and conditional statements.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats using a `for` loop.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A program that prints all possible combinations of two digits from 0 to 99 using nested `for` loops.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A program that prints all possible combinations of three digits, without repetition, from 0 to 999 using nested `for` loops.
- `7-islower.py`: A function that checks if a given character is a lowercase letter.
- `8-uppercase.py`: A function that prints a string in uppercase.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A function that returns and prints the last digit of a given number.
- `10-add.py`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-pow.py`: A function that computes the power of a number using the exponentiation operator (`**`).
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
- `13-insert_number.c`, `lists.h`: A C program and header file that define a structure and functions for manipulating a singly linked list.
- `100-print_tebahpla.py`: A program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters, using a `for` loop and conditional statements.
- `101-remove_char_at.py`: A function that creates a copy of a string with a character at a specified position removed.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: A Python function that replicates the bytecode of a given function.

## Usage

You can run each Python program individually by executing `python <filename>` in the terminal, where `<filename>` is the name of the Python file you want to run.

For example:
To use the C program `13-insert_number.c`, compile it using a C compiler and run the resulting executable.
