# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This repository contains solutions for tasks and projects related to the topic of More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary in Python programming language.

## Description
In this project, we explore the concepts of sets and dictionaries in Python and learn how to effectively use them in various scenarios. We cover topics such as set operations, dictionary manipulation, key-value pairs, iteration, lambda functions, and map functions.

The project includes several Python scripts, each focusing on a specific task or concept related to sets and dictionaries. These scripts are designed to enhance your understanding of these data structures and their applications in Python.

## Requirements
The Python scripts are written using Python 3. They may have dependencies on other modules or libraries, which are mentioned in each script's header comment.

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts, use the following command:
```
python3 filename.py
```
For VSCode (assuming you have python installed):
```
python filename.py
```

## Files
* **[0-square_matrix_simple.py](./0-square_matrix_simple.py)** - Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
    * Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
    * `matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
    * Returns a new matrix:
        * Same size as `matrix`
        * Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    * Initial matrix should not be modified
    * You are not allowed to import any module
    * You are allowed to use regular loops, `map`, etc.
